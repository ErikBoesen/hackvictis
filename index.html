                                <p><strong>Q:</strong> What is a hackathon?</p>
                                <p><strong>A:</strong> A hackathon is a chance to spend a whole day working on a programming project of your choice. Anything goes: you can make a game, a website, an app, or anything else you can think up.</p>

                                <p><strong>A:</strong> It's not that kind of hacking. At MasonHacks, you'll be building creative new software, rather than breaking into networks, infecting computers with malware, or any other negative practice sometimes connoted by the term "hacking."</p>

                <h3>State Department Partnership</h3>
                <p>We're super excited to announce that we'll be partnering with the US Department of State this year! The State Department has provided us with a (gigantic) dataset giving a history of their diplomats' postings since the 1800s. The Department would like for MasonHacks participants to come up with creative and innovative tools for viewing this data. Such projects will be featured on their website at <a href="https://diplomacy.state.gov">diplomacy.state.gov</a>, and may be used at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. The State Department will also provide tech-field internship opportunities to interested students.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The data can be accessed online <a href="https://github.com/MasonHacks/diplomatic_exchange">on GitHub</a>.</p>
